Don't know what to say about this yet. I am just learning wolframscript
command line and I couldn't get the images to work very well although I did
figure out how to export a plot, so i ended up install a gui to my wsl ubuntu
in order to use jupyter notebooks.

I think something interesting might happen if I keep learning this. I mean, I
might discover something cool, or figure out a way to make an interesting game
or something.

I know it doesn't look like much yet.
